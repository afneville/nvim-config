#+TITLE: Neovim Config

My neovim configuration is heavily inspired by =ChristianChiarulli/LunarVim=, from which it was originally forked. Find out more about that project [[https://github.com/ChristianChiarulli/LunarVim][here]], it is a really good example of what can be done with vim/neovim.

I use neovim for programming and the native LSP client, built-in to neovim 0.5, and accompanying setup from /nvim-lsp/ and /compe/ is very useful. Language server configuration for most languages is taken from the afore-mentioned project.
