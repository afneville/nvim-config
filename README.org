This config for neovim is heavily inspired by =ChristianChiarulli/LunarVim=, from which it was forked. Find out more about that project [[https://github.com/ChristianChiarulli/LunarVim][here]], it is a really good example of what can be done with vim/neovim.

*My Changes:*

- replace some customised plugin configs with their defaults
- remove vscode/vscodium interoperability
- move <leader> keybindings out of which-key config
- create unique/personalised keybindings
- create wrapper functions for setting options/keybindings
