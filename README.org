#+TITLE: Neovim Configuration

My configuration for the Neovim text editor (version =0.8+=).

[[./screenshot.png]]

Neovim is a lightweight, highly configurable terminal-based text editor with a built in LSP client allowing it to interface to an external language server to provide completion, diagnostics and other code actions like an IDE. This combination of features makes it a good editor for programming in many different languages and environments.

I have tried to minimise the number of plugins, keeping only the most essential and widely used. In some cases I have copied lua directly from other configurations/plugins into mine, indicated where appropriate. This will not entirely prevent breaking changes and this configuration will need updating semi-regularly. See =lua/plugins.lua= for a list of installed plugins.

In place of a colour scheme plugin, I am using the set of /base16/ schemes from [[https://github.com/tinted-theming/base16-schemes][this]] repository. The only theme included in this repository is my custom theme in the sytle of vs****'s default. To install a larger set of themes:

#+begin_src sh
cd utils
./theme_generator.sh
cp colors/* ../colors
#+end_src
